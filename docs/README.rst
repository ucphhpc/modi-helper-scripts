========================

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

To build the documentation for `modi-helper-scripts` locally, the requirements defined in `requirements.txt` needs to be installed first.
This is achived by running the following command::

    # Best practice, create a seperate virtual environment
    python3 -m virtualenv venv
    source venv

    # Install the requirements
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Afterwards, you can now build the docs, with one of the supported targets by executing::

    (venv) machine@distro:~/repos/modi-helper-scripts/doc$ make
    Sphinx v4.1.2
    Please use 'make target' where target is one of
    html        to make standalone HTML files
    dirhtml     to make HTML files named index.html in directories
    singlehtml  to make a single large HTML file
    pickle      to make pickle files
    json        to make JSON files
    htmlhelp    to make HTML files and an HTML help project

    devhelp     to make HTML files and a Devhelp project

Publish Documentation

To publish the defined documentation, simply push the applied change to the `master` branch.
Readthedocs will then take of rebuilding the `https://modi-helper-scripts.readthedocs.io/` page.
